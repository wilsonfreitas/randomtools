# randomtools

**randomtools** is a python module which has educational purposes. It's mainly concerned with helping people understand how to easyly generate random variable for some of the well known distributions (like gaussian and poison) – and some others less popular (like power laws and Levy) – and how to perform tests on those generated samples.
Here it follows some list with distributions I'd like to implement.
The *italic* one have already been implemented and others don't.
I also intend to show how to use **randomtools** to simulate some stochastic processes.

Continuous Distributions:

*	*uniform*
*	*gaussian* (Park & Miller)
*	*gaussian* (Central Limit Theorem)
*	gaussian with interpolation (article)
*	gaussian (Moro Inversion)
*	*exponential*
*	*lognormal*
*	gamma
*	levy
*	power law (Pareto)
*	beta

Discrete Distributions:

*	*poisson*
*	*binomial*
*	negative binomial
*	geometric

Stochastic Processes:

*	Geometric Brownian Motion
*	Arithmetic Brownian Motion
*	Mean reversion
*	Mean reversion with jumps

<!-- *	noise decorators -->
