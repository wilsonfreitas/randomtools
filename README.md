# randomtools

**randomtools** is a python module which has educational purposes.
It's mainly concerned with helping people understand how to easyly generate random variables for some of the well known distributions (like gaussian and poison) â€“ and some others less popular (like power laws and Levy).
It will also help with understanding how to perform tests on generated random samples.
Here it follows a list with some distributions I'd like to implement.
The *emphasized* distribution names have already been implemented.
I also intend to show how to use **randomtools** to simulate some stochastic processes.

Continuous Distributions:

*	*uniform*
*	*gaussian* (Box & Muller transformation)
*	*gaussian* (Marsaglia polar method)
*	*gaussian* (Central Limit Theorem)
*	*gaussian* (Moro Inversion)
*	*exponential*
*	*lognormal*
*	gaussian with interpolation (article)
*	gamma
*	levy
*	power law (Pareto)
*	beta

Discrete Distributions:

*	*poisson*
*	*binomial*
*	negative binomial
*	geometric

Stochastic Processes:

*	Geometric Brownian Motion
*	Arithmetic Brownian Motion
*	Mean reversion
*	Mean reversion with jumps

<!-- *	noise decorators -->
